About me
======
Hello! 

I am ~25 years old bionformatician from Moscow. I love probability theory, stats, and programming and I am aiming to use them to revolutionize biomedicine and computational biology. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, especially hard science fiction, and photography [BTW, I am a mediocre photographer]. 

Here I am going to post some useful staff [maybe, but can't promise :D] and share my experience of learning C++ [I have no idea why do I need it, but I have already accepted that not everything that happens is meaningful] and linear algebra.
