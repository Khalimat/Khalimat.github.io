As the interest in functional genomics increases so does the need for effective mathematical, computational, and statistical approaches, which serve as hyperdrive for exploring of genetic data space. One of difficult problems in genome annotation is determination of precise positions of transcription start sites (TSS). Determination of eukaryotic TSS is a convoluted task due to complexity of genome architecture, existence of alternative TSSs on genes, gene-specific nucleotide compositions and requirements for additional data incorporation for model building (CAGE, 5’-EST, DNA methylation, distribution of SNPs, characteristic regulatory elements), but it is an essential preparatory step for motif discovery and reconstruction of gene regulatory networks. We have developed an efficient deep learning approach for prediction of the position of transcription start sites in eukaryotes using nucleotide sequence. The approach is data-type independent and allows of incorporation of additional data types (such as RNA-seq and tissue specific DNA methylation) refining positions of TSS for tissue-specific and stress-specific expressions.
