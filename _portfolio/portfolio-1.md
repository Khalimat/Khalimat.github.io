I have finally assembled an active learning pipeline for SCAMs prediction. Actually, it could be used for any binary classification task in cheminformatics.
A UML-diagram that describes the pipeline is bellow:

Code is available [here](https://github.com/Khalimat/JCIM/blob/main/Code/main.py). Please, see the [requirements](https://github.com/Khalimat/JCIM/blob/main/requirements.txt) and [env](https://github.com/Khalimat/JCIM/blob/main/scams_project_env.txt) files before running the pipeline.
