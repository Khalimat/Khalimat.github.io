2017-11-29	How good are publicly available web services that predict bioactivity profiles for drug repurposing?	SAR and QSAR in Environmental Research	Drug repurposing provides a non-laborious and less expensive way for finding new human medicines. Computational assessment of bioactivity profiles shed light on the hidden pharmacological potential of the launched drugs. Currently, several freely available computational tools are available via the Internet, which predict multitarget profiles of drug-like compounds. They are based on chemical similarity assessment (ChemProt, SuperPred, SEA, SwissTargetPrediction and TargetHunter) or machine learning methods (ChemProt and PASS). To compare their performance, this study has created two evaluation sets, consisting of (1) 50 well-known repositioned drugs and (2) 12 drugs recently patented for new indications. In the first set, sensitivity values varied from 0.64 (TarPred) to 1.00 (PASS Online) for the initial indications and from 0.64 (TarPred) to 0.98 (PASS Online) for the repurposed indications. In the second set, sensitivity values varied from 0.08 (SuperPred) to 1.00 (PASS Online) for the initial indications and from 0.00 (SuperPred) to 1.00 (PASS Online) for the repurposed indications. Thus, this analysis demonstrated that the performance of machine learning methods surpassed those of chemical similarity assessments, particularly in the case of novel repurposed indications.

2018-07-01	Computer prediction of the drug-drug interactions severity	FEBS Open Bio	When several drugs are co­administrated, a drug­drug interaction (DDI) phenomenon may appear. Many DDIs are due to changes in the metabolism of drugs. In this case, DDI is manifested by the effect of one drug on the biotransformation of other drugs, its slowdown (in case of inhibition of drug­metabolizing enzymes) or acceleration (in case of induction of drug­metabolizing enzymes), which leads to a change in the pharmacological action of co­administrated drugs. The severity of DDIs can be classified by applying different classification systems. One of the most advanced is OpeRational ClassificAtion (ORCA) system for the classification of DDI, created for physicians to assess the risk of co­administration of two drugs. ORCA divides DDI into five classes: contraindicated (class 1), provisionally contraindicated (class 2), conditional (class 3), minimal risk (class 4), no interaction (class 5). For computer prediction of the severity of DDI, we collected a training set consisting of about 4000 pairs of 500 drugs that belong to classes 1­3 of DDI in case of coadministration. The prediction of DDI classes is based on a combination of modified MNA descriptors ­ PoSMNA (Pairs of Substances Multilevel Neighbourhoods of Atoms), and a classification algorithm implemented in the PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) software. The average invariant accuracy of prediction, calculated in the leave­one­out and 20­fold cross­validation procedures, is about 0.9.

2019-11-01	TransPrise: a novel machine learning approach for eukaryotic promoter prediction	PeerJ	As interest in genetic resequencing increases, so does the need for effective mathematical, computational, and statistical approaches. One of the difficult problems in genome annotation is determination of precise positions of transcription start sites. In this paper we present TransPrise—an efficient deep learning tool for prediction of positions of eukaryotic transcription start sites. Our pipeline consists of two parts: the binary classifier operates the first, and if a sequence is classified as TSS-containing the regression step follows, where the precise location of TSS is being identified. TransPrise offers significant improvement over existing promoter-prediction methods. To illustrate this, we compared predictions of TransPrise classification and regression models with the TSSPlant approach for the well annotated genome of Oryza sativa. Using a computer equipped with a graphics processing unit, the run time of TransPrise is 250 minutes on a genome of 374 Mb long. The Matthews correlation coefficient value for TransPrise is 0.79, more than two times larger than the 0.31 for TSSPlant classification models. This represents a high level of prediction accuracy. Additionally, the mean absolute error for the regression model is 29.19 nt, allowing for accurate prediction of TSS location. TransPrise was also tested in Homo sapiens, where mean absolute error of the regression model was 47.986 nt. We provide the full basis for the comparison and encourage users to freely access a set of our computational tools to facilitate and streamline their own analyses. The ready-to-use Docker image with all necessary packages, models, code as well as the source code of the TransPrise algorithm are available at (http://compubioverne.group/). The source code is ready to use and customizable to predict TSS in any eukaryotic organism.  	"Pachganov​, S*; Murtazalieva​, K*, et al. (2019).

2021-04-10	CFM: a database of experimentally validated protocols for chemical compound-based direct reprogramming and transdifferentiation	F1000Research	Cell fate engineering technologies are critically important for basic and applied science, yet many protocols for direct cell conversions are still unstable, have a low yield and require improvement. There is an increasing need for a data aggregator containing a structured collection of protocols -  preprocessed, verified, and represented in a standardized manner to facilitate their comparison, and providing a platform for the researchers to evaluate and improve the protocols.   We developed CFM (cell fate mastering), a database of experimentally validated protocols for chemical compound-based direct reprogramming and direct cell conversion. The current version of CFM contains 169 distinct protocols, 113 types of cell conversions, and 158 small molecules capable of inducing cell conversion. CFM allows stem cell biologists to compare and choose the best protocol with high efficiency and reliability for their needs. The protocol representation contains PubChem CIDs and Mechanisms Of Action (MOA) for chemicals, protocol duration, media , and yield with a comment on a measurement strategy. Ratings of the protocols and feedback from the community will help to promote high-quality and reproducible protocols. We are committed to a long-term database maintenance strategy. The database is currently available at: https://cfm.mipt.ru	"Sizykh, A; Murtazalieva, K. (2021).
