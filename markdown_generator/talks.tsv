TransPrise - a deep learning approach for prediction of Eukaryotic transcription start sites	Talk	_	Moscow Conference on Computational Molecular Biology (MCCMB’19)	2019-07-28	Moscow, Russia	_	As the interest in functional genomics increases so does the need for effective mathematical, computational, and statistical approaches, which serve as hyperdrive for exploring of genetic data space. One of difficult problems in genome annotation is determination of precise positions of transcription start sites (TSS). Determination of eukaryotic TSS is a convoluted task due to complexity of genome architecture, existence of alternative TSSs on genes, gene-specific nucleotide compositions and requirements for additional data incorporation for model building (CAGE, 5’-EST, DNA methylation, distribution of SNPs, characteristic regulatory elements), but it is an essential preparatory step for motif discovery and reconstruction of gene regulatory networks. We have developed an efficient deep learning approach for prediction of the position of transcription start sites in eukaryotes using nucleotide sequence. The approach is data-type independent and allows of incorporation of additional data types (such as RNA-seq and tissue specific DNA methylation) refining positions of TSS for tissue-specific and stress-specific expressions.

How good are publicly available web services that predict bioactivity profiles for drug repurposing? 	Talk	_	9th Internat. Symp. on Computational Methods in Toxicology & Pharmacology Integrating Internet Resources (CMTPI-2017)	2017-10-28	Goa, India	_	Drug repurposing provides a non-laborious and less expensive way for finding new human medicines. Computational assessment of bioactivity profiles shed light on the hidden pharmacological potential of the launched drugs. Currently, several freely available computational tools are available via the Internet, which predict multitarget profiles of drug-like compounds. They are based on chemical similarity assessment (ChemProt, SuperPred, SEA, SwissTargetPrediction and TargetHunter) or machine learning methods (ChemProt and PASS). To compare their performance, this study has created two evaluation sets, consisting of (1) 50 well-known repositioned drugs and (2) 12 drugs recently patented for new indications. In the first set, sensitivity values varied from 0.64 (TarPred) to 1.00 (PASS Online) for the initial indications and from 0.64 (TarPred) to 0.98 (PASS Online) for the repurposed indications. In the second set, sensitivity values varied from 0.08 (SuperPred) to 1.00 (PASS Online) for the initial indications and from 0.00 (SuperPred) to 1.00 (PASS Online) for the repurposed indications. Thus, this analysis demonstrated that the performance of machine learning methods surpassed those of chemical similarity assessments, particularly in the case of novel repurposed indications.
